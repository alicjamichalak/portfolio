            <h2>
                My name is Alicja and I'm Computer Science graduate. If university taught me anything it's that knowledge doesn't come on it's own. You need to fight for it !
            </h2>
            <p>
                <strong>As a young person </strong>I am very determined to explore new fields and get as much knowledge as possible. I consider myself a quick learner and I have always respected my teachers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope I will get a chance to learn from experienced people, so I can develop my skills in web designing. I have always been a prefecionist, so I will never stop improving myself which I consider to be a great quality for a new employee.
            </p>

            <h3>If it comes to my strongest characteristicks..</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Hard working! </strong> I have been giving up 100% of myself in any job I've had. I love beeing productive and improving myself to get as great at something as possible. It might seem that working as a waitress has nothing to do
                with IT. But it did tought me a lot!
            </p>

            <p>
                Dealing with customers can be a really hard job. When people make complaints to you and you have to stay calm and explain to them politely that they make no sense. That's the hard part...
            </p>

            <h3>Managing the team.</h3>
            <p>
                That's another one of the struggles. As a young person it wasn't easy for me to get people's respect. Especially from those who've worked longer than me or just older than me. The most important part of beeing a leader is not to just tell employees what
                to do. It is to show them how to do it and work with them as equals!
            </p>
            <p>
                Beeing abroad also helped me with my language.
                <strong>
            Learning enhlish at school and actually talking to people is a
            comepletly different thing!
          </strong> From this point I knew I had to speak as much as I can. You can't just say one word that you forgot in your own language and people will understand. You need to describe the word, make a circle around it and try to
                explain what do you want to say. That's the greatest advantage you can get from living abroad. The abillity to improvise, to think in other language, to speak fluently...
            </p>
            <p>
                That's a great experience for anyone!
            </p>
